## Telemetry Data Analysis

### Key Performance Indicators Before Failure

| Metric | Value 7 Days Before | Value 24h Before | At Failure | Normal Range | Deviation |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Health Index** | 1.8 | 2.9 | 3.2 | < 1.0 | +220% |
| **Vibration RMS** | 2.1 mm/s | 4.8 mm/s | 6.7 mm/s | < 2.5 mm/s | +168% |
| **Power Consumption** | 1850 W | 2140 W | 2450 W | 1800 W | +36% |
| **Bearing Temperature** | 68°C | 89°C | 112°C | < 75°C | +49% |
| **RUL** | 350 h | 45 h | -120 h | > 1000 h | Critical |

### Contributing Factors

- Progressive increase in vibration levels over 3-week period
- Elevated bearing temperatures indicating friction increase
- Power consumption trending upward suggesting mechanical resistance
- Health index degradation accelerating in final 48 hours

## Visual Inspection Findings

### Disassembly Observations

**Shaft Condition:**
- Complete fracture at main bearing location
- Fracture surface shows fatigue crack propagation
- Evidence of stress concentration at bearing seat

**Bearing Condition:**
- Severe wear on outer race
- Ball bearing discoloration indicating overheating
- Excessive radial play measured (0.8mm vs 0.15mm specification)

**Internal Contamination:**
- Significant process byproduct deposits in rotor assembly
- Deposits particularly heavy near exhaust stages
- Material analysis indicates silicon oxide particulates

## Root Cause Analysis - 5 Whys

### Technical Analysis

**Why did the pump fail?**
→ Shaft fractured at main bearing location

**Why did the shaft fracture?**
→ Excessive cyclical stress loads on shaft

**Why were there excessive loads?**
→ Main bearing seized due to wear and contamination

**Why did the bearing seize?**
→ Bearing degraded from extended operation beyond service life with process contamination

**Why was it operated beyond service life?**
→ Run-to-fail operating mode with no preventive maintenance schedule

### Systemic Analysis

**Why is run-to-fail mode used?**
→ No established preventive maintenance program for this tool

**Why is there no PM program?**
→ Historical reliability assumed adequate; cost optimization priority

**Why was degradation not detected earlier?**
→ Telemetry monitoring in place but no proactive intervention protocol

**Why was no intervention taken despite telemetry alerts?**
→ Alerts noted but not escalated; no clear escalation threshold defined

**Root Cause**: Inadequate maintenance strategy combined with unclear escalation protocols for telemetry degradation indicators

---

## Ishikawa Diagram Analysis

### Materials
- Process byproduct accumulation (silicon oxide)
- Bearing material wear under extended duty cycle

### Method
- Run-to-fail maintenance approach
- Insufficient intervention thresholds for telemetry alerts

### Machine
- Pump exceeded target lifetime by 14%
- Bearing wear accelerated by contamination

### Environment
- PECVD process generates particulate byproducts
- Inadequate purge gas flow to prevent contamination

### Measurement
- Telemetry monitoring active but response protocol unclear
- No defined critical threshold for immediate action

### Manpower
- Unclear ownership of telemetry alert response
- Insufficient training on early intervention protocols
