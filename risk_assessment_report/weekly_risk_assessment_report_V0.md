## Section 1: Critical Risk Assets (2 Assets) - Detailed Analysis

### VP-001 - Turbomolecular Pump (HiPace 700)
**Location**: Fab 1, Etch Tool Bay 3, Line 2  
**Risk Score**: ![Critical](https://img.shields.io/badge/89%25-red) **Status**: ![Critical](https://img.shields.io/badge/Critical-red)<br>

**Risk Assessment Summary**: VP-001 exhibits converging failure indicators across multiple systems. Operating 8°C above critical temperature threshold (73°C vs 65°C max) with vibration levels 18% beyond safe limits (2.95 mm/s vs 2.5 mm/s max). Power consumption increased 22% above baseline, indicating severe mechanical stress. At 4.5 years old (90% of expected lifespan), MTBF has dropped to 145 days—60% below the 365-day target. The combination of thermal, mechanical, and electrical deterioration indicates imminent bearing seizure or rotor damage.

## Summary and Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 12-48 Hours)
1. **VP-001**: Emergency replacement required within 12 hours
2. **VP-007**: Scheduled replacement within 48 hours
3. Verify spare part availability for critical replacements

### Lifecycle Management Insights
**Key Finding**: Asset age alone is not a reliable predictor of failure risk. Performance-based assessment reveals that well-maintained pumps can safely operate beyond expected lifetime when monitored appropriately.

**Continuation Criteria for EOL Assets**:
- Temperature within 85% of threshold
- Vibration levels below 90% of limits  
- Power consumption increase <10%
- MTBF above 250 days

**Cost Optimization**: Assets VP-045 and VP-062 demonstrate that performance-based replacement can extend operational life by 20-30%, providing significant cost savings while maintaining reliability.

### Fleet Health Score: ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/76%25-green)
**Overall Assessment**: Fleet demonstrates good health despite critical assets requiring immediate attention. Lifecycle management approach enables optimized replacement scheduling and reduced unnecessary maintenance costs.
