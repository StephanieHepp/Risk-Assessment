## Executive Dashboard - Fleet Overview

### Fleet Risk Distribution

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor':'#ff6600', 'secondaryColor':'#4CAF50', 'tertiaryColor':'#f5f5f5'}}}%%
pie title Fleet Risk Distribution (200 Assets)
    "Critical (A) - 2 Assets" : 2
    "High (B) - 15 Assets" : 15
    "Medium (C) - 42 Assets" : 42
    "Low-Medium (D) - 67 Assets" : 67
    "Low (E) - 74 Assets" : 74
```

**Fleet Status**: 2 assets (1%) are in critical condition requiring immediate action, while 183 assets (91.5%) operate in acceptable ranges (low-medium). The 17 critical/high-risk assets represent our primary focus area.

### Real-Time IoT Status Overview

%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor':'#ff6600', 'secondaryColor':'#4CAF50'}}}%%
pie title IoT Asset Status (200 Connected Assets)
    "Running Normal - 134 Assets" : 140
    "Warning Status - 58 Assets" : 58
    "Alarm Status - 2 Assets" : 2
```

**IoT Health**: 140 assets (70%) of fleet operating normally, 85 assets (29%) showing warnings, 2 assets (1%) in alarm state. All alarm-status assets correlate with critical risk category, confirming our risk assessment accuracy.
