## Fleet Performance Analytics

### Risk Distribution by Age Groups

```mermaid
%%{init: {
  "theme": "base",
  "themeVariables": {
    "background": "#ffffff"   /* Wei른r Hintergrund */
  }
}}%%
xychart-beta
    title "Fleet Risk Profile by Age Groups"
    x-axis ["0-1 Years (45 assets)", "1-2 Years (52 assets)", "2-3 Years (48 assets)", "3-4 Years (35 assets)", "4-5 Years (20 assets)"]
    y-axis "Average Risk Score (%)" 0 --> 70
    bar "Average Risk" [8, 15, 25, 45, 62]
    line "Critical Threshold (80%)" [80, 80, 80, 80, 80]
    line "High Risk Threshold (60%)" [60, 60, 60, 60, 60]
```

**Age Analysis**: Risk accelerates significantly after 3 years, with 4-5 year assets averaging 62% risk score. This data supports our 4-year replacement strategy for high-utilization pumps.

### Technology Type Risk Distribution

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor':'#ff6600', 'secondaryColor':'#4CAF50'}}}%%
pie title "Critical/High Risk by Pump Type"
    "Turbomolecular (12 assets)" : 12
    "Dry Scroll (6 assets)" : 6
    "Rotary Vane (3 assets)" : 3
    "Roots Blower (2 assets)" : 2
```

**Technology Insights**: Turbomolecular pumps represent 52% of high-risk assets despite being 40% of fleet, indicating higher maintenance complexity and failure rates in high-vacuum applications.

### Monthly Fleet Reliability Trend

```mermaid
%%{init: {
  "theme": "base",
  "themeVariables": {
    "background": "#ffffff"   /* Wei른r Hintergrund */
  }
}}%%
xychart-beta
    title "Fleet MTBF and Availability Trends (8-Month View)"
    x-axis ["Jan 2025", "Feb 2025", "Mar 2025", "Apr 2025", "May 2025", "Jun 2025", "Jul 2025", "Aug 2025"]
    y-axis "Performance %" 85 --> 100
    line "Fleet Availability" [97.8, 96.5, 97.2, 94.8, 95.1, 96.9, 94.2, 94.2]
    line "Target Availability (99%)" [99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99, 99]
    line "MTBF Index (Scaled)" [92, 89, 91, 85, 87, 93, 88, 86]
```

**Reliability Trend**: Fleet availability has declined 3.6% from January peak, now 4.8% below target. MTBF degradation correlates with availability decline, indicating systematic aging across multiple asset groups.

## Predictive Analytics Insights

### Failure Mode Analysis (Fleet-Wide)

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor':'#ff6600', 'secondaryColor':'#4CAF50'}}}%%
pie title "Primary Failure Modes - Critical/High Risk Assets (23 Total)"
    "Bearing Wear/Failure - 9 Assets" : 9
    "Seal Degradation - 5 Assets" : 5
    "Motor/Electrical Issues - 4 Assets" : 4
    "Contamination/Oil Issues - 3 Assets" : 3
    "Thermal Problems - 2 Assets" : 2
```

**Failure Pattern**: Bearing-related failures dominate (39% of high-risk assets), suggesting opportunity for enhanced lubrication protocols and bearing upgrade programs.

### Risk Velocity Tracking

```mermaid
%%{init: {
  "theme": "base",
  "themeVariables": {
    "background": "#ffffff"   /* Wei른r Hintergrund */
  }
}}%%
xychart-beta
    title "Risk Acceleration Patterns (30-Day Velocity)"
    x-axis ["Week 1", "Week 2", "Week 3", "Week 4"]
    y-axis "Assets Crossing Risk Thresholds" 0 --> 8
    bar "New Critical Assets" [1, 2, 3, 2]
    bar "New High Risk Assets" [3, 4, 2, 6]
    line "Trend (Total New High+Critical)" [4, 6, 5, 8]
```

**Risk Velocity**: Asset degradation is accelerating, with 8 new high/critical assets in week 4 vs. 4 in week 1. This 100% increase indicates systematic issues requiring fleet-wide intervention.

```

**Production Risk**: Advanced node lines (7nm/14nm) carry 65% of critical/high-risk assets but generate 78% of revenue. Line 1 faces highest exposure with 2 critical pumps supporting $2.1M daily production.
