### Telemetry Analysis

| Metric | Current Value | Baseline | Deviation | Status |
|--------|---------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Health Index** | 2.5 | < 1.0 | +150% | 🔴 Critical |
| **Vibration RMS** | 3.2 mm/s | 2.3 mm/s | +40% | 🔴 Critical |
| **Power Consumption** | +7% | Baseline | +7% | 🟠 Elevated |
| **Temperature** | Normal | Normal | 0% | 🟢 Normal |

### Trend Visualization

**Vibration Trend (Last 14 Days)**:
- Week 1: Gradual increase from 2.4 mm/s to 2.8 mm/s
- Week 2: Accelerated increase from 2.8 mm/s to 3.2 mm/s (current)
- Projection: Continued degradation expected without intervention

**Contributing Factors**:
- RMS vibration (primary indicator)
- Power consumption increase
- High runtime utilization (93% of target lifetime)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Historical Context

Past incidents on this pump model indicate that rising vibration is often associated with:
1. **Bearing wear** - Most common failure mode (60% of cases)
2. **Exhaust restriction** - Secondary cause (30% of cases)
3. **Mechanical misalignment** - Less common (10% of cases)

### Risk Assessment

**Failure Probability**: High (86% risk score)

**Consequences of Continued Operation**:
- Increased risk of bearing seizure
- Potential catastrophic failure
- Unplanned downtime impact on production
- Secondary damage to connected equipment

**Time to Failure Estimate**: 7-14 days of continued operation at current degradation rate

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action Required (0-7 Days)

**Primary Recommendation**: Schedule pump removal for preventive bearing inspection and replacement

| Action Item | Details | Priority |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Action** | Pump Removal & Inspection | 🔴 Critical |
| **Target Date** | October 28, 2025 | 7 days from report |
| **Estimated Downtime** | 4-6 hours | Standard procedure |
| **Parts Required** | Front bearing assembly, seals | Pre-order recommended |
| **Labor** | 2 technicians | Coordinate scheduling |

### Alternative Actions (If Immediate Removal Not Feasible)

1. **Increase Monitoring Frequency**: Daily telemetry review instead of weekly
2. **Reduce Process Load**: Lower chamber utilization to reduce pump stress
3. **Emergency Spares**: Position backup pump for hot-swap if failure occurs

---

## Customer Validation Required

**Awaiting Customer Decision**:

- [ ] **Approve Recommendation** - Proceed with scheduled pump removal on October 28, 2025
- [ ] **Decline Recommendation** - Continue operation with enhanced monitoring (not recommended)

**Customer Comments**:

---

**Next Steps Upon Approval**:
1. Coordinate production schedule for chamber downtime
2. Order replacement parts (2-day lead time)
3. Schedule maintenance crew
4. Prepare backup pump if available
5. Update CMMS with work order
