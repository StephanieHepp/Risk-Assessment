- Statistical failure analysis (Weibull, Monte Carlo)
- Machine learning pattern recognition
- Historical performance correlation

**Continuation Criteria for EOL Assets**:
- Temperature within 85% of threshold
- Vibration levels below 90% of limits  
- Power consumption increase <10%
- MTBF above 250 days
- RUL confidence level >65%

**Cost Optimization**: Assets VP-045 and VP-062 demonstrate that performance-based replacement can extend operational life by 20-30%, providing combined cost savings of $37,600 while maintaining reliability. The predictive maintenance program delivers $139,600 in total cost avoidance across the analyzed asset portfolio.

### Fleet Health Score: ![Good](https://img.shields.io/badge/76%25-green)
**Overall Assessment**: Fleet demonstrates good health despite critical assets requiring immediate attention. Lifecycle management approach enables optimized replacement scheduling, reduces unnecessary maintenance costs, and maximizes asset utilization while maintaining operational reliability.

**Financial Performance**: The predictive maintenance program demonstrates strong ROI at 347%, primarily through:
- Proactive replacement scheduling (avoiding emergency premiums)
- Extended asset lifecycle management
- Reduced unplanned downtime
- Optimized spare parts inventory
