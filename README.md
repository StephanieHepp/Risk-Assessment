# Risk Assessment Report Development - Project Summary

## Project Context & Business Transformation

### Business Model Evolution
We are developing solutions for **Busch Vacuum and Pfeiffer Vacuum**, original equipment manufacturers transitioning from a traditional transactional business model to a service-oriented approach. Instead of simply selling vacuum pumps and basic maintenance services, the company is moving toward **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** that guarantee specific uptime percentages for manufacturing facilities.

### Target Application Domain
The primary application is **semiconductor manufacturing plants** where vacuum pumps are critical infrastructure components. Production downtime due to pump failures can cost tens of thousands of dollars per hour, making predictive maintenance and risk assessment essential for business success.

## Key Personas

### 1. Subfab Manager (End Customer)
- **Role**: Internal employee responsible for semiconductor manufacturing plant operations
- **Primary Concern**: Maintaining continuous production and preventing unexpected downtime
- **Information Need**: Real-time health status of deployed vacuum devices and risk visibility

### 2. CIP (Continuous Improvement) Engineer (Busch/Pfeiffer Employee)
- **Background**: Originally field service technicians performing on-site maintenance
- **Evolved Role**: Digital-enabled consultants using IoT telemetry data for predictive analysis
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Equipment health monitoring and analysis
  - Proactive failure prevention
  - Customer consultation on operational optimization
  - Risk assessment and maintenance planning

## CIP Engineer Job Functions (Jobs-to-be-Done Analysis)

1. **Classification of Installed Base**: Risk categorization for every asset based on failure impact and likelihood
2. **Alarm Management**: Proactive management of potential equipment failures before downtime occurs
3. **Runtime Management**: Evaluation of assets approaching target lifetime for safe operation decisions
4. **Failure Analysis**: Root cause investigation and structured reporting of equipment failures
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Performance data review and optimization recommendations

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Classification System
- **Category A (Critical)**: P₃₀ ≥ 80% - Act now
- **Category B (High)**: 60-80% - Schedule ASAP  
- **Category C (Medium)**: 30-60% - Intensify monitoring
- **Category D (Low-Medium)**: 10-30% - Routine checks
- **Category E (Low)**: <10% - Low risk

### Risk Calculation Methodology
Risk assessment based on **survival analysis** and **condition monitoring**, incorporating:
- Remaining useful lifetime
- Mean time between failure (MTBF)
- Asset age and design life consumption
- Real-time sensor data (vibration, temperature, power consumption)
- Process criticality and business impact

## Deliverables Created

## Competency Questions for Knowledge Graph Validation

### Question Categories Developed

#### Level 1: Immediate Tactical Questions (Crisis Management)
