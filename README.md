## üöÄ Overview

A next-generation knowledge management and decision support system for **CIP (Continuous Improvement) Engineers** and manufacturing teams. This system transforms Confluence knowledge pages into an intelligent knowledge graph and provides specialized AI agents for different roles in semiconductor manufacturing.

### Business Context & Transformation

We are developing solutions for **Busch Vacuum and Pfeiffer Vacuum**, original equipment manufacturers transitioning from a traditional transactional business model to a service-oriented approach. Instead of simply selling vacuum pumps and basic maintenance services, the company is moving toward **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** that guarantee specific uptime percentages for manufacturing facilities.

The primary application is **semiconductor manufacturing plants** where vacuum pumps are critical infrastructure components. Production downtime due to pump failures can cost tens of thousands of dollars per hour, making predictive maintenance and risk assessment essential for business success.

### Key Innovation
- **Confluence-Driven Knowledge Graph**: Domain expertise from wiki pages becomes queryable relationships
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for CIP Engineers, Subfab Managers, Service Admins, and Knowledge Specialists
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic similarity (vectors) with logical relationships (graph traversal)
- **Production-Ready**: On-premises deployment with enterprise Neo4j clustering
- **Service-Oriented Business Model**: Enables transition from equipment sales to SLA-based service contracts

## üë• Key Personas & Use Cases

### 1. Subfab Manager (End Customer)
- **Role**: Internal employee responsible for semiconductor manufacturing plant operations
- **Primary Concern**: Maintaining continuous production and preventing unexpected downtime
- **Information Need**: Real-time health status of deployed vacuum devices and risk visibility
- **Use Cases**:
  - "What's the production impact if VP-001 fails?"
  - "Show me maintenance schedule conflicts this week"
  - "How does our pump reliability compare to benchmarks?"

### 2. CIP (Continuous Improvement) Engineer (Busch/Pfeiffer Employee)
- **Background**: Originally field service technicians performing on-site maintenance
- **Evolved Role**: Digital-enabled consultants using IoT telemetry data for predictive analysis
- **Responsibilities**: Equipment health monitoring, proactive failure prevention, customer consultation
- **Use Cases**:
  - "Which pumps are at critical risk in the next 30 days?"
  - "Why is VP-001's MTBF below baseline?"
  - "What maintenance procedures are needed for HiPace 700?"

### 3. Knowledge Specialists
- **Role**: Domain experts managing technical documentation and procedures
- **Use Cases**:
  - "How is the P‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ risk score calculated?"
  - "What's the complete bearing replacement procedure?"
  - "Which safety standards apply to turbomolecular pump maintenance?"

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üß† **Intelligent Risk Assessment**: Automated pump failure risk analysis with P‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ calculations
- ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Specialization**: Different AI agents for technical, business, and administrative queries
- üìö **Knowledge Integration**: Confluence pages automatically become searchable knowledge graphs
- üîç **Hybrid Search**: Vector similarity + graph relationships for comprehensive answers

## üéØ CIP Engineer Job Functions (Jobs-to-be-Done)

1. **Classification of Installed Base**: Risk categorization for every asset based on failure impact and likelihood
2. **Alarm Management**: Proactive management of potential equipment failures before downtime occurs
3. **Runtime Management**: Evaluation of assets approaching target lifetime for safe operation decisions
4. **Failure Analysis**: Root cause investigation and structured reporting of equipment failures
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Performance data review and optimization recommendations

## üìä Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Classification System
- **Category A (Critical)**: P‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ ‚â• 80% - Act now
- **Category B (High)**: 60-80% - Schedule ASAP  
- **Category C (Medium)**: 30-60% - Intensify monitoring
- **Category D (Low-Medium)**: 10-30% - Routine checks
- **Category E (Low)**: <10% - Low risk

### Risk Calculation Methodology
Risk assessment based on **survival analysis** and **condition monitoring**, incorporating:
- Remaining useful lifetime
- Mean time between failure (MTBF)
- Asset age and design life consumption
- Real-time sensor data (vibration, temperature, power consumption)
- Process criticality and business impact

### Competency Questions for Knowledge Graph Validation

The system has been validated against **70 comprehensive competency questions** spanning seven levels:

#### Level 1: Immediate Tactical Questions (Crisis Management)
- Which pumps require immediate replacement and what's the expected failure timeline?
- What spare parts do I need on-hand for the next 48 hours?
- Which production lines will be affected if VP-001 fails during the next shift?

#### Level 2: Operational Analysis Questions
- Why is VP-001's MTBF 50% below baseline - is this a design issue or operational stress?
- What operating conditions are causing accelerated wear on our turbomolecular pumps?
- Should we increase maintenance frequency for pumps operating in harsh etch environments?

#### Level 3: Strategic Planning Questions
- What's the overall health trend of our turbomolecular pump fleet?
- How does our fleet performance compare to industry benchmarks?
- Which pump models consistently outperform others in our environment?

#### Level 4-7: Root Cause, Business, Analytics, and Continuous Improvement
- Advanced failure analysis, cost optimization, machine learning integration, and process improvement questions
