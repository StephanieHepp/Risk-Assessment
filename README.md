## 🚀 Overview

A next-generation knowledge management and decision support system for **CIP (Continuous Improvement) Engineers** and manufacturing teams. This system transforms Confluence knowledge pages into an intelligent knowledge graph and provides specialized AI agents for different roles in semiconductor manufacturing.

### Key Innovation
- **Confluence-Driven Knowledge Graph**: Domain expertise from wiki pages becomes queryable relationships
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for CIP Engineers, Subfab Managers, Service Admins, and Knowledge Specialists
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic similarity (vectors) with logical relationships (graph traversal)
- **Production-Ready**: On-premises deployment with enterprise Neo4j clustering

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧠 **Intelligent Risk Assessment**: Automated pump failure risk analysis with P₃₀ calculations
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Specialization**: Different AI agents for technical, business, and administrative queries
- 📚 **Knowledge Integration**: Confluence pages automatically become searchable knowledge graphs
- 🔍 **Hybrid Search**: Vector similarity + graph relationships for comprehensive answers
- 📊 **Real-Time Analytics**: Integration with Databricks health metrics and DTF sensor data
- 🏭 **On-Premises Deployment**: Complete data control with enterprise-grade infrastructure
- 📈 **Predictive Maintenance**: ML-driven insights for pump maintenance optimization

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Kubernetes cluster (for production)
- Neo4j Enterprise License
- Confluence Cloud/Server access
- OpenAI API key

### 🚀 5-Minute Demo

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cip-knowledge-graph.git
cd cip-knowledge-graph

# 2. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials

# 3. Deploy the system
./deploy.sh

# 4. Access the system
open http://localhost:3000  # Frontend interface
open http://localhost:7474  # Neo4j Browser
```

### 🧪 Test with Sample Data

```bash
# Load sample risk assessment data
python scripts/load_sample_data.py

# Test the CIP Engineer agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Which pumps require immediate replacement?"}'
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### For CIP Engineers
- **Risk Assessment**: "Which pumps are at critical risk in the next 30 days?"
- **Troubleshooting**: "Why is VP-001's MTBF below baseline?"
- **Maintenance Planning**: "What maintenance procedures are needed for HiPace 700?"

### For Subfab Managers  
- **Business Impact**: "What's the production impact if VP-001 fails?"
- **Resource Planning**: "Show me maintenance schedule conflicts this week"
- **Fleet Analysis**: "How does our pump reliability compare to benchmarks?"

### For Knowledge Specialists
- **Methodology**: "How is the P₃₀ risk score calculated?"
- **Procedures**: "What's the complete bearing replacement procedure?"
- **Standards**: "Which safety standards apply to turbomolecular pump maintenance?"
