%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor':'#ff6600', 'secondaryColor':'#4CAF50', 'tertiaryColor':'#f5f5f5'}}}%%
pie title Fleet Risk Distribution (200 Assets)
    "Critical (A) - 2 Assets" : 2
    "High (B) - 15 Assets" : 15
    "Medium (C) - 42 Assets" : 42
    "Low-Medium (D) - 67 Assets" : 67
    "Low (E) - 74 Assets" : 74
```

**Fleet Status**: 1% of assets are in critical condition requiring immediate action, while 91.5% operate in acceptable ranges (low-medium). The 17 critical/high-risk assets represent our primary focus area.

### Real-Time IoT Status Overview

## Fleet Performance Analytics

### Risk Distribution by Age Groups

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor':'#ff6600'}}}%%
xychart-beta
    title "Fleet Risk Profile by Age Groups"
    x-axis ["0-1 Years (45 assets)", "1-2 Years (52 assets)", "2-3 Years (48 assets)", "3-4 Years (35 assets)", "4-5 Years (20 assets)"]
    y-axis "Average Risk Score (%)" 0 --> 70
    bar "Average Risk" [8, 15, 25, 45, 62]
    line "Critical Threshold (80%)" [80, 80, 80, 80, 80]
    line "High Risk Threshold (60%)" [60, 60, 60, 60, 60]
```

**Age Analysis**: Risk accelerates significantly after 3 years, with 4-5 year assets averaging 62% risk score. This data supports our 4-year replacement strategy for high-utilization pumps.

### Technology Type Risk Distribution

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor':'#ff6600', 'secondaryColor':'#4CAF50'}}}%%
pie title "Critical/High Risk by Pump Type"
    "Turbomolecular (12 assets)" : 12
    "Dry Scroll (6 assets)" : 6
    "Rotary Vane (3 assets)" : 3
    "Roots Blower (2 assets)" : 2
```

**Technology Insights**: Turbomolecular pumps represent 52% of high-risk assets despite being 40% of fleet, indicating higher maintenance complexity and failure rates in high-vacuum applications.

### Monthly Fleet Reliability Trend

    "Contamination/Oil Issues - 3 Assets" : 3
    "Thermal Problems - 2 Assets" : 2
```

**Failure Pattern**: Bearing-related failures dominate (39% of high-risk assets), suggesting opportunity for enhanced lubrication protocols and bearing upgrade programs.

### Risk Velocity Tracking

```mermaid
