## Fleet Analytics & Cost Impact

### Maintenance Distribution

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor':'#ff6600'}}}%%
pie title "Maintenance Type Distribution (Last 30 Days)"
    "Planned Maintenance - 70%" : 70
    "Emergency Repairs - 30%" : 30
```

**Plot Description**: This distribution shows an unhealthy maintenance profile with 30% emergency repairs versus the industry best practice of <15%. The high emergency repair rate indicates reactive rather than proactive maintenance, leading to higher costs and unplanned downtime. This metric directly correlates with our SLA underperformance.

### Cost Trend Analysis

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor':'#ff6600'}}}%%
xychart-beta
    title "Monthly Maintenance Costs ($K)"
    x-axis ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug"]
    y-axis "Cost ($K)" 0 --> 80
    bar "Emergency Repairs" [25, 35, 42, 38, 52, 28, 41, 45]
    bar "Planned Maintenance" [18, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 21, 22]
    bar "Target Emergency (<$30K)" [30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30]
```

**Plot Description**: Monthly cost analysis reveals emergency repair expenses consistently exceed our $30K target, with a spike to $52K in May. Emergency repairs cost 2-3x more than planned maintenance due to overtime labor, expedited parts, and production losses. August's $45K emergency spending is directly attributable to our current critical pump issues.
