# Inexperienced CIP Engineer Competency Questions
*Knowledge Transfer Framework for Intelligent Assistant Development*

---

## 1. Classification of Installed Base (Risk Assessment)

### **General**
1. What does status mean?
2. How can I interpret each chart type in the risk assessment report?

### **Understanding Risk Categories**
3. What exactly does a risk score of 85% mean, and why is it critical?
4. How do you calculate the risk percentage for an asset?
5. What's the difference between impact and likelihood in risk assessment?
6. Why does pump age affect risk differently for turbomolecular vs. scroll pumps?
7. How do I explain to a customer why their 3-year-old pump is high-risk while another 4-year-old pump is low-risk?

### **Process Context Understanding**
8. What makes an etch process more 'harsh' on pumps than CVD?
9. Why do load lock pumps have different failure patterns than chamber pumps?
10. How does process chemistry affect pump degradation rates?
11. What's the relationship between process pressure and pump stress?
12. Why do some fab environments cause faster pump aging?

## 2. Alarm Management & Proactive Intervention

### **Alarm Interpretation**
13. What's the difference between a warning alarm and a critical alarm?
14. How do I prioritize multiple simultaneous alarms across the fleet?
15. Why did this temperature alarm trigger when the value seems close to normal?
16. What does 'trending toward failure' mean in practical terms?
17. How long do I have to respond to each type of alarm?
18. What shall I do when an alarm / a warning happend?
19. What types of actions can I suggest when there is an alarm? 

### **Threshold Understanding**
20. Why are the warning thresholds set at these specific values?
21. How were the critical thresholds determined for this pump model?
22. Can thresholds be adjusted based on process conditions?
23. What happens if I ignore a warning alarm?
24. Why do older pumps have different thresholds than newer ones?

### **Proactive Actions**
25. What actions should I recommend when vibration is trending upward but still below critical?
26. How do I explain to a customer why we need to act on a 'yellow' status?
27. What's the difference between enhanced monitoring and immediate replacement?
28. How do I convince a customer to schedule maintenance for a 'working' pump?
29. What backup options should I discuss when recommending pump replacement?

## 3. Runtime Management & Lifecycle Planning

### **Lifetime Assessment**
30. How do you determine when a pump has reached its target lifetime?
31. What factors extend or shorten pump operational life?
32. Why might we recommend early replacement of a 'green status' pump?
33. How do duty cycles affect pump lifetime calculations?
34. What's the difference between calendar age and operational age?

### **Risk vs. Runtime Balance**
34. When is it safe to extend operation beyond recommended lifetime?
35. How do you balance cost savings vs. failure risk for lifetime decisions?
36. What operating conditions allow for extended runtime?
37. How do I explain the concept of 'acceptable risk' to a customer?
38. What monitoring frequency is needed for pumps on extended runtime?
39. If the risk is lower than 85 %, does this mean that no failure will happen?

### **Replacement Planning**
40. How far in advance should we plan pump replacements?
41. What factors determine replacement scheduling priority?
42. How do seasonal production demands affect replacement timing?
43. What's the lead time impact on replacement decisions?
44. How do you coordinate multiple pump replacements to minimize downtime?

## 4. Failure Analysis & Root Cause Investigation

### **Data Interpretation for Failure Analysis**
45. What pump parameters indicate bearing failure vs. seal failure?
46. How do you differentiate between normal aging and premature failure?
47. What data patterns suggest contamination vs. mechanical wear?
48. How do environmental factors show up in the telemetry data?
49. What combination of parameters indicates specific failure modes?

### **Root Cause Methodology**
50. What systematic approach should I follow for failure investigation?
51. How do I separate symptoms from actual root causes?
52. What questions should I ask the customer about operating conditions?
53. How do I use historical data to support root cause analysis?
54. What external factors could contribute to unexpected failures?

## 5. Performance Trend Analysis

### **Performance Trend Analysis**
55. How do you identify patterns across multiple similar pumps?
56. What constitutes a 'recurring issue' requiring systematic action?
57. How do you separate correlation from causation in performance data?
58. What time periods should I analyze for meaningful trends?
59. How do I benchmark one customer's performance against industry standards?

## 6. Technology & Tools Understanding

### **IoT Data Interpretation**
60. What does 'real-time monitoring' actually measure and how often?
61. How accurate are the IoT sensors for different parameters?
62. What data quality issues should I watch for?
63. How do I validate sensor readings against manual measurements?
64. What happens when IoT connectivity is lost?

### **Predictive Analytics**
65. How far in advance can we predict failures?
66. What's the difference between correlation and prediction?
