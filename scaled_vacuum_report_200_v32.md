xychart-beta
    title "Fleet Risk Profile by Age Groups"
    x-axis ["0-1 Years (45 assets)", "1-2 Years (52 assets)", "2-3 Years (48 assets)", "3-4 Years (35 assets)", "4-5 Years (20 assets)"]
    y-axis "Average Risk Score (%)" 0 --> 80
    bar "Average Risk" [8, 15, 25, 45, 62]
    line "A Critical Threshold (80%)" [80, 80, 80, 80, 80]
    line "B High Risk Threshold (60%)" [60, 60, 60, 60, 60]
```

**Age Analysis**: Risk accelerates significantly after 3 years, with 4-5 year assets averaging 62% risk score. This data supports our 4-year replacement strategy for high-utilization pumps.

### Technology Type Risk Distribution

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor':'#ff6600', 'secondaryColor':'#4CAF50'}}}%%

## Predictive Analytics Insights

### Failure Mode Analysis (Fleet-Wide)

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor':'#8B0000', 'secondaryColor':'#228B22'}}}%%
pie title "Primary Failure Modes - Critical/High Risk Assets (23 Total)"
    "Bearing Wear/Failure - 9 Assets" : 9
    "Seal Degradation - 5 Assets" : 5
    "Motor/Electrical Issues - 4 Assets" : 4
    "Contamination/Oil Issues - 3 Assets" : 3
    "Thermal Problems - 2 Assets" : 2
```

**Failure Pattern**: Bearing-related failures dominate (39% of high-risk assets), suggesting opportunity for enhanced lubrication protocols and bearing upgrade programs.

**Failure Mode Determination Method**: Failure modes identified through systematic IoT parameter pattern analysis:
- **Bearing Wear**: Simultaneous increase in vibration (>10% above baseline) + temperature rise + power consumption increase
- **Seal Degradation**: Pressure rise during operation + pumping speed decline (>15% below rated) + motor current increase  
- **Motor/Electrical**: Current spikes + power factor changes + thermal signatures in electrical components
- **Contamination**: Oil analysis results + gradual performance decline + increased operating temperatures
- **Thermal Problems**: Temperature excursions beyond thresholds + cooling system inefficiency indicators

### Risk Velocity Tracking

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'base', 'themeVariables': {'primaryColor':'#000000', 'primaryTextColor':'#000000', 'primaryBorderColor':'#000000', 'lineColor':'#666666'}}}%%

    bar "New B High Risk Assets" [3, 4, 2, 6]
    line "Trend (Total New High+Critical)" [4, 6, 5, 8]
```

**Risk Velocity**: Asset degradation is accelerating, with 8 new high/critical assets in week 4 vs. 4 in week 1. This 100% increase indicates systematic issues requiring fleet-wide intervention.
